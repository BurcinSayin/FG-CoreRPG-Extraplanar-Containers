# CoreRPG Extraplanar Containers
This extension provides support for extraplanar containers by ignoring the weight of carried (but not equipped) items in supported containers.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.0.10 (2021-02-04).
This works with CoreRPG, 3.5E, 5E, PFRPG, and possibly more, although the items it looks for are based on Pathfinder 1e.

If you have two containers with the same name (such as two backpacks) you may encounter unintended behavior. To work around this, give them a descriptive or functional name like "green backpack" or "backpack of food".

# Features
This extension provides support for extraplanar containers by ignoring the weight of carried (but not equipped) items in supported containers ('weightless', 'extraplanar', 'of holding', 'portable hole', 'handy haversack', 'efficient quiver').
It also provides subtotals in the item sheets of those containers, warns when the container is overfull, and checks that contents are small enough to fit inside the container.
Supported mundane containers ('container', 'backpack', 'pouch', 'quiver', and 'bag') will benefit from the subtotal and maximum size and capacity features, but not the weightless contents.
